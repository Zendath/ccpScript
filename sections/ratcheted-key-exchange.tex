\section{Ratcheted Key Exchange}
\label{sec:rke}

We have seen plenty forward secure key exchange protocols in the previous chapters, but there is another security guarantee that is desirable in practice:
Post-compromise security~(PCS), which is the ability to recover from a compromise.
We adapt Figure~\ref{fig:fs:sketch}, which showed the idea of forward security, to show the idea of a protocol that provides both forward and post compromise security (Figure~\ref{fig:rke:pcs_fs_overview}).

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \input{figures/rke/pcs_fs_overview}
    \caption{A sketch of forward and post compromise security.}
    \label{fig:rke:pcs_fs_overview}
\end{figure}

A way to achieve post compromise security are the so-called Ratcheted Key Exchange protocols~(RKE).
In Figure~\ref{fig:rke:overview}, an abstract view on a two party RKE protocol is given.
After the initial key exchange, both parties regularly update their keys in a Ratcheted Key Exchange step.
Using the resulting key, a new message can be encrypted.

For the steps different cryptographic building blocks are used.
For example, X3DH might be used for the initial key exchange, the Signal Double Ratchet algorithm for the Ratcheted Key exchange step and AEAD for the encryption of the messages.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Types of RKE}
\alert{PR: add history starting with Double Ratchet, then its analysis~\cite{JC:CCDGS20}, then unidirectional~\cite{C:BSJNS17}, then more~\cite{C:PoeRos18}}
RKE protocols can be divided into three types, depending on the directions of communication they support.
Bidirectional RKE protocols is the intuitive case, where full bidirectional communication is supported~(Figure~\ref{fig:RKE:bi}).

Sesquidirectional RKE gives one party full functionality, while the other party can only send ``non-functional'' messages.
Consider for example the ciphertext $c_3$ in Figure~\ref{fig:RKE:sesq}:
It does not encapsulate a key, instead it should be used for efficiency or security (e.g. Bob can use this message to communicate fresh randomness to Alice to recover from earlier compromise).
Every Sesquidirectional RKE protocol can be transformed into a bidirectional RKE protocol, by using two instances of the Sesquidirectional RKE protocol.

        \label{fig:RKE:sesq}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Interaction in bi- and sesquidirectional RKE protocols.}
\end{figure}

The third type of RKE protocols is unidirectional RKE, which only allows one party to send.
For simplicity, this is the type of RKE we will focus on in the following.

\subsection{Unidirectional RKE}

An overview of the unidirectional RKE protocol is given in Figure~\ref{fig:rke:uni}.
It should be noted that Bob is purely deterministic.
He can not distribute fresh randomness, and therefore can not recover from corruptions.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \input{figures/rke/rke_uni}
    \caption{Unidirectional RKE protocol.}
    \label{fig:rke:uni}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Syntax} A unidirectional RKE protocol $\URKE=(\URKEinit, \URKEsnd, \URKErcv)$ has the following syntax:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\URKEinit: \emptyset\tor\stsp_A\times\stsp_B$
    \item $\URKEsnd: \stsp_A\tor\stsp_A\times\ksp\times\csp$
    \item $\URKErcv: \stsp_B\times\csp\to\stsp_B\times\ksp$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Correctness} The correctness of $\URKE$ is defined as follows:
\begin{align*} %too long to fit on one line
    \Pr[k_A^i=k_B^i\mid &(\st_A^0, \st_B^0)\getsr\URKEinit, \\
                        &(\st_A^i, k_A^i, c_A^i)\getsr\URKEsnd(\st_A^{i-1}), \\
                        &(\st_B^i, k_B^i)\gets\URKErcv(\st_B^{i-1}, c_B^i)] = 1
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Security} The advantage of an adversary $\advA$ against the $\IND_\URKE^b$ game shown in Figure~\ref{fig:urke:ind} is defined as follows:
\[\Adv_\URKE^\ind(\advA) = \left|\Pr[\IND_\URKE^0(\advA)=1] - \Pr[\IND_\URKE^1(\advA)=1]\right|\]

\paragraph{Trivial winning conditions} The four trivial attacks against the game $\IND_\URKE^b$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:urke:trivial}.

\end{figure}

%this paragraph is not precise and understandable enough in my opinion
\paragraph{Intuitive Security Goals} The security goal for unidirectional RKE protocols is to ensure that sender and receiver exposures are as harmless as possible.
In particular, the sender state should only allow for \emph{immediate} impersonations, i.e. it should not reveal any (challenge) keys except the one received in the impersonation.
The receiver state should only reveal future ``compatible'' (challenge) keys; an active attacker breaks ``compatibility''.

This means that the protocol is forward secure w.r.t. exposures of senders and receivers.
Post-compromise security is only achieved for the sender, who is also hard to non-trivially impersonate.


\paragraph{Construction} A construction for a unidirectional RKE protocol $\URKE$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:urke:const}.

    \label{fig:urke:const}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Random Oracle Model}

To analyze the security of the unidirectional RKE protocol $\URKE$, we use the random oracle model~(ROM).
The random oracle model is a common abstraction in cryptography and models an ideal hash or one-way function.

In the ``arrows-and-boxes'' style, the random oracle is shown in its own box instead of being called with $h\getsr \ROh$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:rom:overview}).
Reduction and adversary interact with the random oracle just like they normally would.
It is important to keep in mind, that the random oracle is still part of the reduction.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Security Proof of URKE in the ROM}

\paragraph{Proof Sketch} 
First, assume that the verification key $\vk_i$ is authentically transmitted based on authenticity of signature $\sig_{i-1}$.
This implies that the ciphertext $c_i$ is transmitted authentically unless the sender is trivially impersonated.
The first assumption can be reduced to the $\SUFCMA$ security of the underlying signature scheme $\SIG$.

Secondly, assume that the ciphertext $c_i$ protects the intermediate key $k'$.
Then the random oracle input in the $i$-th send operation is secret, which implies that the random oracle output is also secret.
We can then assume, that the $i+1$-th $\KEM$ instance protects the $i+1$-th ciphertext and its key, which can be reduced to the $\INDCCA$ security of the $\KEM$.

\paragraph{Theorem}
The proof sketch gives a preliminary security bound:

For every successful adversary $\advA$ against $\IND$ security of scheme $\URKE$, there exist adversaries $\advB_\SIG$ and $\advB_\KEM$ such that
\[\Adv_\URKE^\ind (\advA)\leq x\cdot \Adv_\SIG^\sufcma(\advB_\SIG) + y\cdot \Adv_\KEM^\indcca(\advB_\KEM)+z\]

The need for the factors $x, y$ and $z$ becomes clear in the concrete proof in the next section.

\paragraph{Formal Proof}
We now prove the security of the $\URKE$ scheme through a series of games:

%set game i as the itemize bullet points to ensure no text under the game i label
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2.0cm]
    \item[Game 0:] The original game $\IND_\URKE^b$.
    \item[Game 1:] Guess $n_{forge}\getsr [q_{rcv}+1]$, where $q_{rcv}$ is the number of queries to $\Orcv$.
        If the $n_{forge}$-th query to oracle $\Orcv$ is not one that flips the bit $\mathit{sync}$ from $1$ to $0$, abort the game.

        It holds that $\Adv^0=\Adv^1\cdot(q_{rcv}+1)$.
    \item[Game 2:] If in the $n_{forge}$-th query to oracle $\Orcv$ the sender was not exposed for the corresponding prior state (i.e.,$n_{forge}\notin X_S$) and the received ciphertext was accepted (i.e., $k_0\neq\bot$), then abort the game.
        The advantage is
        \[\Adv^1\leq\Adv^2 + \Adv_{\SIG}^\sufcma(\advB_\SIG)\]
    \item[Game 3:] Guess $n_{exp}\getsr [q_{rcv}]$.
        If the receiver state is not exposed for the first time after the $n_{exp}$-th query to oracle $\Orcv$, abort the game.

        It holds that $\Adv^2=\Adv^3\cdot q_{rcv}$.
        
    \listintertext{For the next games we use the hybrid argument over $n_{snd}$ steps, where $n_{snd}=\begin{cases}
        q_{snd} &, n_{exp}>n_{forge}\\
        n_{exp} &, \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$}
    \item[Game 4:] Lazy sample output of random oracle in the $i$-th query to $\Osnd$.
        Lazy sampling means, that the output of the random oracle gets computed only when the adversary queries the corresponding inputs ``externally''. 

        It is $\Adv^3=\Adv^4$.
    \item[Game 5:] Abort if the adversary queries the random oracle for the inputs specified by the $i$-th query to oracle $\Osnd$.
        The advantage is
        \[\Adv^4\leq\Adv^5 + \Adv_\KEM^\owcca(\advB_\KEM)\]
\end{itemize}

We show indistinguishability of game 1 and game 2 by reducing every successful distinguisher $\advD_1^2$ to a successful attacker against the $\SUFCMA$ security (Figure~\ref{fig:sig:suf}) of the signature scheme $\SIG$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Oracle $\Osnd$: 
        In $n_{forge}-1$-th query embed the verification key $\vk$ in $c$.\par
        In $n_{forge}$-th query ask the signing oracle of $\SUFCMA$ game for $\sig$ with $m:=(c',\vk')$.
        \item  Oracle $\Oexpr$: 
        After $n_{forge}-1$-th query to $\Orcv$, embed $\vk$ in $\st_R$.
        \item Everything else is simulated honestly
    \end{itemize}
    \item Extraction: Distinguisher $\advD_1^2$ can only distinguish between game 1 and game 2 if game 2 aborts.
    This only happens upon successful signature forgery.
\end{itemize}

Similarly, we prove indistinguishability of games 4 and 5 for every distinguisher $\advD_4^5$ by reducing to $\OWCCA$ security (Figure~\ref{fig:kem:ow:cca}) of the $\KEM$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Simulation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Oracle $\Oexps$: 
        After the $i-1$-th query to $\Osnd$, embed the encapsulation key $\ek$ in $\sk_S$.
        \item  Oracle $\Osnd$: 
        In $i$-th query, embed the challenge ciphertext $c^*$ from the underlying $OWCCA_\KEM$ game as the $\KEM$ ciphertext 
        \item Oracle $\Orcv(c)$: If $c$ was a trivial impersonation in $i$-th query to $\Orcv$, use oracle $\Odec$ of $\OWCCA$ game.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Extraction: The only way to distinguish games 4 and 5 for the adversary is to query the random oracle with the same inputs as the $i$-th $\Osnd$ query would.
    Then, if the random oracle is queried with $x=(t,k',c)$ s.t. $t$ and $c$ match with internal values for $i$-th $\Osnd$ query, send $k'$ to $\OWCCA$ game.

\end{itemize}

After the $n_{snd}$-th hybrid step in game 5, all challenge keys are random oracle outputs for which adversary $\advA$ never queried random oracle on the corresponding inputs.
It follows that $\Adv^5=0$.

Taking the advantages together, the following concrete security bound for scheme $\URKE$ can be formulated:
\[\Adv_\URKE^\ind(\advA) \leq (q_{rcv}+1)\cdot(\Adv_\SIG^\sufcma(\advB_\SIG)+q_{rcv}\cdot q_{snd}\Adv_\KEM^\owcca(\advB_\KEM))\]
