\textbf{Exercize:} The exercize is split into two parts. Some tasks can be submitted online via the interactive StudOn quiz. Solving these quizzes awards bonus points for the final exam, if it is passed (at most a 0.7 grade improvement).

Some tasks are not part of the quiz and will be discussed in the following exercize sessions. These tasks do not count towards bonus points, but are still important to form a deeper understanding of the more complex systems.

\textbf{Recordings:} Lecture recordings from 2024 are available at \url{https://video.cs.fau.de/by-lecture/CCP/2024s}. The exercize is not recorded!
