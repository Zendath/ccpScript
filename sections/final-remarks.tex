\section{Final Remarks}
It should be noted, that there are limits to the models used in the lecture and to provable security in general.
For example, cryptographic proofs are usually written at a high level and new attack vectors can be introduced during the translation of pseudocode to actual code.
Furthermore, some attack vectors are not considered, like parsing or timing attacks.
For this reason, libraries should be used whenever possible.

Limitations can also arise through side-channels in the hardware or through the end user themselves.
If the protocol's usability is too low, users might be unable to use it correctly.
